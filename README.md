This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Just put `yarn install` and ### `yarn start` in your terminal inside project folder. 

This project is an authentication and user login screen in React using Firebase in Backend to meet the requirement for data to be in the cloud.

Authentication process with the identifier:

- The user who doesn' t have an account fills in email and password and clicks the Sign-Up button. Creating the user in the bank and being directed to HOME.

- If the user already has an account, login with it. As an example, I left two accounts registered:

malone@gmail.com
thiagolucio@gmail.com

Password for both created accounts is "123456"

It could have been much more beautiful, with a much more beautiful interface and with much better UX than my specialties because
 I'm not a great programmer, but I really didn't have time for that. It was just the basics.

Unfortunately, I work by the hour and as we are in the final stretch of a project I am working even on weekends to get the delivery for February 10th. 
I started doing this Saturday at the end of the day and now on Sunday a little bit, but there won't be time to conclude. 
I apologize and appreciate the opportunity.
